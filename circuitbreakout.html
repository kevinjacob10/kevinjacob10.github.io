        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Circuit Breakout: Dual Polarity is a fast-paced action game centered around 
            a dynamic polarity-switching combat mechanic. Players must strategically 
            shift between two energy states to counter enemy types, navigate hazards, 
            and optimize combat flow.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project focused heavily on systemic design, responsiveness, and scalable 
            gameplay architecture to support future content expansion and commercial release.

        <h2>My Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul class="responsibilities-list">
            <li>Designed and implemented the core dual polarity combat system</li>
            <li>Developed a modular ability framework supporting scalable mechanics</li>
            <li>Built enemy AI architecture using state-based behavior systems</li>

        <h2>Core Systems</h2>

        <div class="system-block">
            <h3>Dual Polarity System</h3>
            <p>
                The core mechanic allows the player to switch between two energy states 
                to counter specific enemy types. Matching polarity increases damage output, 
                while mismatched polarity reduces effectiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system was architected using a modular state manager, allowing clean 
                separation between player logic, combat calculations, and feedback systems.
                This ensured rapid iteration and future extensibility.
            </p>
        </div>
<div class="system-block">
            <h3>Ability System Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                Designed a reusable ability framework that supports cooldown-based actions, 
                conditional triggers, layered effects, and scalable expansion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Abilities were built using a data-driven approach to reduce hardcoding 
                and improve designer iteration speed.

        <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>

        <div class="challenge-block">
            <h3>Responsive State Switching</h3>
            <p>
                Ensuring polarity switching felt instantaneous without breaking animation flow 
                required decoupling gameplay logic from animation states.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implemented buffered input handling and state validation checks to maintain 
                responsiveness under high-action scenarios.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge-block">
            <h3>System Scalability</h3>
            <p>
                Early prototypes exposed limitations in tightly coupled systems. 
                Refactored core logic into modular components to allow expansion 
                without architectural rewrites.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge-block">
            <h3>Combat Feedback Clarity</h3>
            <p>
                Balancing mechanical depth with player readability required clear 
                audiovisual feedback for polarity interactions and damage states.

        <h2>Outcome & Learnings</h2>
        <p>
            Circuit Breakout strengthened my approach to modular system design, 
            scalable architecture, and gameplay clarity. The project reinforced 
            the importance of decoupled systems for rapid iteration and long-term maintainability.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also highlighted the balance required between mechanical complexity 
            and player readability in action-driven gameplay systems.
